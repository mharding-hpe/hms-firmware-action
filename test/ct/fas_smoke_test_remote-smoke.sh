#     DESCRIPTION       : Automated test for verifying basic Firmware Action
#                         Service (FAS) API infrastructure and installation
#                         on Cray Shasta systems.

#
#     LAST MODIFIED     : 09/22/2020
#
#     SYNOPSIS
#       This is a smoke test for the HMS FAS API that makes basic HTTP
#       requests using curl to verify that the service's API endpoints
#       respond and function as expected after an installation.
#
#     INPUT SPECIFICATIONS
#       Usage: fas_smoke_test
#       
#       Arguments: None
#
#     OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS
#       Plaintext is printed to stdout and/or stderr. The script exits
#       with a status of '0' on success and '1' on failure.
#
#     DESIGN DESCRIPTION
#       This smoke test is based on the Shasta health check srv_check.sh
#       script in the CrayTest repository that verifies the basic health of
#       various microservices but instead focuses exclusively on the FAS
#       API. It was implemented to run from the ct-pipelines container off
#       of the NCN of the system under test within the DST group's Continuous
#       Testing (CT) framework as part of the remote-smoke test suite.
#
#     SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
#       Must be executed from the ct-pipelines container on a remote host
#       (off of the NCNs of the test system) with the Continuous Test
#       infrastructure installed.
